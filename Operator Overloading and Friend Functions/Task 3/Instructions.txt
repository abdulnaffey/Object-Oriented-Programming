Write a C++ program to create a complex number class. Write getter setter, constructor,
destructor,and all overloaded operators needed to run the given driver code.

class complex 
{
 private:
	int real;
	int imag;
 public:

		//All functions that are needed.

};


int main() 
{

	complex c1(5,7);		// for complex numbers, such as 5+7i
	complex c2(5); 		// for numbers without imaginary part as 5 + 0i
	complex c3(); 
	complex c4(); 
	c3 = c1+c2; 
	c4 = c1-c2; 
	c5 = c3*c4; 
	c6 = c4/c5; 
	return 0;
 }
