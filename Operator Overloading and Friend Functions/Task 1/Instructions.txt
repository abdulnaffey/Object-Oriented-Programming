Letâ€™s create a class Time to work with a 12-hour formatted time having the following attributes:

	int* hours
	int* minutes
	int* seconds

Provide the following functions:
	1. According to the rule of three:
		i. Copy Constructor
		ii. operator =
		iii. Destructor
	2. Overloaded constructor with default values
	3. Getter of each attribute (setters are NOT required)
	4. operator ==
	5. operator >
	6. As discussed in class, only using operator == and operator >, provide
	   implementation of:
		i. operator !=
		ii. operator <
		iii. operator <=
		iv. operator >=
	7. operator << //Example Output 2:13:47
	8. operator >>
	9. operator + //to add two values of time
	10. operator - //to subtract two values of time
	11. operator ++
		i. post-increment
		ii. pre-increment
	12. operator --
		i. post-increment
		ii. pre-increment

Make sure to check that the time remains valid in all the functions that are:
	A. 1 <= hours <=12
	B. 0 <= minutes < 60
	C. 0 <= seconds < 60
