Repeat task 1, to create a class for Date; however, no need to take pointer attributes; the
attributes will therefore be:

		int day;
		int month;
		int year;

	1. Rule of three is NOT required (we donâ€™t have any pointer attribute). Rule of three is
   	   required only if there is at least one pointer attribute.
	2. Overloaded constructor with default values
	3. Getter of each attribute (setters are NOT required)
	4. operator ==
	5. operator >
	6. As discussed in class, only using operator == and operator >, provide
	   implementation of:
		i. operator !=
		ii. operator <
		iii. operator <=
		iv. operator >=
	7. operator << //Example Output: 30-4-2013
	8. operator >>
	9. operator + //to add integer days in a Date
	   Hint: The porotype should be:
		Date operator + (int d) 	//where d is days
	   Example: 20-3-1985 + 16 days will return date as: 5-4-1985
	10. operator - 		//to subtract two values of time
	11. Hint: The porotype should be:
		Date operator - (int d) 	//where d is days
		Example: 20-3-1985 - 155 days will return date as: 16-10-1984
	12. operator ++
		i. post-increment
		ii. pre-increment
	13. operator --
		i. post-increment
		ii. pre-increment

	Make sure to check that the date remains valid in all the functions that are:

		A. 1 <= day <= 31
		B. 0 <= month <= 12
		C. 0 <= year <= n 	where n is a positive integer
