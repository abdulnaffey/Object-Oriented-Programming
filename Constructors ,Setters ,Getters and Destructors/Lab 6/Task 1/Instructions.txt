Define a class Car having attributes    

	•	name (char *)   
	•	model (char* )   
	•	noOfDoor (int*)
   
   
Now do the following operations on the above-mentioned class:   
	
	1.	Write default constructor, parameterized constructor, and copy constructor.
	2.	Write separate setter functions for each attribute to set value (with no memory leakage).  
	3.	Write separate getter functions for each attribute to get value.
	4.	Write a destructor (with an output statement to check the lifetime scope of the object). 
	5.	Write a display() function to display attributes of class Car on screen.   
  
   
Now write the main function to declare different objects of class Cat. Then call the display function against every object to see the information stored.
