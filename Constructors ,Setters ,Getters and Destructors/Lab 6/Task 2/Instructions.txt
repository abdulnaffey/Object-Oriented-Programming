Define a class Employee having attributes    

	•	name (char *)   
	•	hourly_pay_rate (float*)   
	•	working_hours(int*)
   
   
Now do the following operations on above-mentioned class:   
	
	1.	Write default constructor, parameterized constructor and copy constructor.
	2.	Write separate setter functions for each attribute to set value (with no memory leakage).  
	3.	Write separate getter functions for each attribute to get value.
	4.	Write a destructor (with an output statement to check the lifetime scope of object). 
	5.	Write a display() function to display attributes of class Employee on screen.   
	6.	Write an AddSal() function, which adds $10 to the salary of the employee if it is less than $500
	7.	Write an “AddWork()” function, which adds $5 to the salary of the employee if the number of hours of work per day is more than 6 hours.
